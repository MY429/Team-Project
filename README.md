# Project Proposal

## The Big Idea: 

## Learning Objectives: 

## Implementation Plan: 

## Project Schedule: 
Project is due on April 29th, which gives us roughly three weeks to complete the project. Here are the initial deadlines we set for the project: 

April 13th: Determine the API and write up initial codes to execute the API. 

April 20st: Set up HTML webpage, connect API and the HTML get and post codes.

April 27th: Finalize the project, design website UI/UX, along with any outstanding write-ups. 

## Collaboration Plan: 
Since both team members live off-campus and in Newton area, we will meet up weekly together to work on the project together. Both team members work better together to help each other work on different parts of the code and address questions or concerns. 

## Risks and Limitations:
Concerning the completion of the project, the most significant threat is to complete and work on the project according to the deadline setup rather than procrastinating to the last minute. To mitigate the risk, we will set these projected schedules as hard deadline in order to move along. 

## Additional Course Content: 
Some course contents that might be important to the completion of our project are: 
Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, API, Text analysis.
