## Project Proposal
 
## The Big Idea: For our project, we envision to build a platform that allow users to be able to check and compare hotel rating and prices of hotels in the United States. We would like to create website using free hotel information APIs. We expect the final product to ease the users' pain of finding hotel by allowing them to enter and select location in the States to come out with hotels nearby and their ratings accordingly.

## Learning Objectives: Our learning objectives would be to leverage what we learned in class and exercise it into out project. We are expected to use flask, templates and other things taught in class in this project.

### Implementation Plan: We will search for a useable yet free API as out data source and we will come up with the specific plan for implementation later
